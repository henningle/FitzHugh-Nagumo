% Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) applied to FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron dynamics.
% Voltage observed, currents and inputs estimated.
%
% FitzHughNagumo() is the main program and calls the other programs.
%
% A detailed description is provided in
% H.U. Voss, J. Timmer & J. Kurths, Nonlinear dynamical system identification from uncertain and indirect measurements, Int. J. Bifurcation and Chaos 14, 1905-1933 (2004).
% I will be happy to email this paper on request. It contains a tutorial about the estimation of hidden states and unscented Kalman filtering.
